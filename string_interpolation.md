#String Interpolation

#####Objective - Practice using string interpolation.

Replace the blank in each sentence with the variable given above it. The example is done for you!
```ruby
a = "example"  
puts "This is an __________"  
```
becomes
```ruby
puts "This is an #{a}!"  
```
which outputs
```ruby
This is an example!
```

1)
```ruby
name = "John"  
puts "Hello __________! Welcome!"  
```
2)
```ruby
word = "conceive"  
puts "Whatever the mind of man can ________ and believe, it can achieve. – Napoleon Hill"  
```
3)
```ruby
percent = "100%"  
puts "You miss ________ of the shots you don’t take. - Wayne Gretzky"  
```
4) Interpolation works on other objects besides strings.
```ruby
percentage = ["E", "i", "g", "h", "t", "y"]  
puts "_________ percent of success is showing up. - Woody Allen"  
```
5)
```ruby
n = "happens"  
puts "Life is 10% what __________ to me and 90% of how I react to it. – Charles Swindoll"  
```
6)
```ruby
w = "become"  
puts "The mind is everything. What you think you _________.  – Buddha"  
```
